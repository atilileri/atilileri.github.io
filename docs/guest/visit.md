# I bet you can't README.first

> Let's check here first, before asking some common questions.

## Commute
- [Swapfiets](https://maps.app.goo.gl/URJ62NRPzCivDQtv6): You will rent your irreplaceable compadre from here. Your bike. It's the best way to get around any city in the Netherlands.
    - You have to book a timeslot beforehand, from their app.
    - Don't forget to adjust your saddle at the store.
    - They take care of the bike with any problems.
    - They rent bikes for minimum period of a month, with a twist. 
    - You can early-return the bike any time on business hours, or even a friend can drop it for you.
    - Their monthly option with a one-off payment is cheaper than most touristic options. So if you are here for more than 3 days, that's a no brainer. If less, just walk around.
- [NS](https://www.ns.nl/en): Site to find the train tickets in NL. If you have a friend with a subscription (_who could it be?_), you can travel with 40% discount with him (max 2 people). They have an app as well.
- [NS International](https://www.nsinternational.com/en): Same for International tickets.
- [9292](https://9292.nl/en): Great app for public transport schedules. You can even buy the tickets directly from here.
- [NS fiets](#no-link): Subscription owners can rent bikes for 3€/day from every NS train station. Great for day trips.

#### Attractions
- Do your own research, there are lots of websites about Amsterdam. I just prefer getting lost though.
- One thing you might overlook: [Mokumboot Amsterdam Zuid](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eQDi7EWWvrPQe1t69)
    - Private boat rental is not the cheapest option, but the most independent and fun option.
    - It can be hard to find a company to rent. Staff is really welcoming and professional with this one.
    - They have multiple landing spots but I prefer walking to south of the city and get on there. You have to mention explicitly that you want to rent one from south.
